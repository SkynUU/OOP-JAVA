Person Class:
 
Represents an individual with attributes such as first name, last name, age, address, phone number, email, gender, and a flag indicating whether the person is a student.
Provides methods to retrieve the full name and a formatted string representation of the person.
Address Class:
 
Represents a physical address with attributes for the street, city, postal code, and country.
Provides a method to create a formatted string representation of the address.
University Class:
 
Represents a university with attributes such as name, location, established year, rector (head of the university), and an array of students.
Provides methods to retrieve the university name, location, established year, rector's full name, and the list of students.
Usage in Main:
 
Three person instances (representing individuals) are created with specific details.
An address instance for the university is created.
The first person is designated as the rector.
An array of students is initialized with the three person instances.
A university instance is created using the provided details.
Information about individuals and the university is then printed to the console using console.log() statements.
The script demonstrates basic object-oriented principles in TypeScript, encapsulating data and behavior within classes and creating instances to represent entities like persons, addresses, and a university. The usage in the main part of the script showcases how to create instances, set up relationships, and retrieve information from these objects.
